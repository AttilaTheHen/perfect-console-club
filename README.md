# Perfect Console Club

A web app for browsing the perfect consoles of all guests on the My Perfect Console podcast, hosted by Simon Parkin. Users can sign up and add their own perfect consoles, and browse other users' consoles.

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
